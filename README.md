## Coffee-Machine-with-PIC16F877

The Coffee Machine project is an embedded system designed to simulate a vending machine for coffee. It allows users to select their preferred type of coffee, make payments, and receive their chosen beverage. The project integrates various components, including a microcontroller, an LCD display, and a payment mechanism, to create a user-friendly interface. When a user selects a coffee type and completes the payment, the machine activates the coffee dispensing mechanism, delivering the beverage. This project serves as a practical example of how hardware and software can work together to create an interactive experience in a real-world application.

## Overview
The Coffee Machine project simulates a vending machine specifically designed for dispensing coffee. It incorporates various features such as:

- **User Interface**: A clear and intuitive display for users to select their desired coffee type and payment method.
- **Payment System**: A flexible payment method allowing users to insert coins or use a credit system.
- **Coffee Selection**: Options for different types of coffee, each with specific price points.

## Components Used
- **Microcontroller**: The main control unit managing the systemâ€™s operations.
- **LCD Display**: For user interaction and information display.
- **Buttons**: For selecting coffee types and initiating payments.
- **Payment Mechanism**: For accepting coins and managing credit.

## Functionality
1. **Initialization**: The system initializes components and sets up the user interface.
2. **User Input Handling**: The machine responds to user selections and payment inputs.
3. **Coffee Dispensing Logic**: Based on the selection and payment confirmation, the system triggers the coffee dispensing mechanism.
4. **Display Updates**: Continuously updates the user interface to reflect the current status and available options.
